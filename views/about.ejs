    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Climate Solutions is a collection of projects and initiatives aimed at combating climate change and promoting sustainability. 
      This web application showcases various projects across different sectors – from renewable energy to sustainable agriculture – and highlights their impact and goals.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      The application demonstrates a full-stack implementation with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (via Sequelize ORM), and an intuitive front-end styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. 
      Users can browse projects by category, view details, and (with proper authorization) add new projects to the collection.
